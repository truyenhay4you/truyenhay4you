ðŸ‘‹ Hi, this is @truyenhay4you

âš¡ Problem Statement: 
  Stories are a spiritual food, people often read stories in books or websites or on electronic devices such as laptops, phones, ebooks...
  
  But if you read stories for a long time, your eyes will get tired as well as you won't be able to focus on other tasks. 
  It's not convenient. In addition, you must have a screen large enough to read clearly. 
  To solve this problem, audiobook applications were born. 
  Youtube is one of the largest story listening channels today, but there are also many constraints according to their policies, Youtube also has a limitation of being unreadable.
  
  So do you want a quality channel that can help you read and listen at the same time?
